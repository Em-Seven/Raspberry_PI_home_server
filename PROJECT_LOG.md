# Project Log â€“ Raspberry Pi Linux Server

This file documents the steps, configurations, and services set up on my Raspberry Pi to build a secure and functional home server.

---

## Security & Access
- Configured **SSH key authentication** (disabled password login).
- Changed default hostname (not using "raspberry").
- Disabled root login for SSH.
- Restricted SSH access to a **non-default port**.
- Enabled **UFW firewall** with minimal open ports.
- Installed and configured **Fail2Ban** to block brute-force attempts.
- Remote access from outside home network is only allowed via **Tailscale VPN**.

---

## System Maintenance
- Enabled **automatic security updates** via unattended-upgrades.
- Configured system to send an **email notification** after updates (via Gmail SMTP relay).
- Set up **journalctl log management**:
  - Persistent logging enabled (/var/log/journal).
  - Limited log size with SystemMaxUse in journald.conf.
  - Logs rotated automatically to prevent SD card from filling up.
  - Tested log access with journalctl -xe and boot logs with journalctl -b.

---

## File Management
- Enabled **SFTP** for secure file transfer (restricted to SSH key users).
- Installed and configured **FileBrowser** as a web-based file manager.
- Set FileBrowser to **start automatically on boot**.

---

## Monitoring & Observability
- Installed **Netdata** for real-time system monitoring (CPU, RAM, network, services).
- Configured Netdata to run as a service.

---

## Storage & Mounting
- The disk is automatically mounted at boot using /etc/fstab.
- Backups:  
  - Automated daily backups using rsync  
  - Covers:
    - Home directories  
    - System configuration files  
    - System logs  
  - Stored safely on external USB drive  
  - Automated with cron job

---

## Web Hosting & Application Deployment
- **Nginx Web Server**
  - Configured Nginx as the primary web server.
  - Set up a **Server Block** to serve a Laravel application from the `/var/www` directory.
  - Implemented an **Nginx reverse proxy** for Netdata, allowing access through a subdomain.
- **Laravel Framework Integration**
  - Installed PHP, Composer, and the Laravel framework.
  - Deployed the initial **"Under Construction"** landing page.
  - Understood core concepts of the **MVC architecture** (Model, View, Controller), routes, and the Blade templating engine.
- **Secure Public Access with Cloudflare Tunnel**
  - Deployed a **Cloudflare Tunnel** to securely expose the Nginx web server to the internet without opening any firewall ports.
  - This provides automated HTTPS encryption and DDoS protection.

---

## Notes
- All services are configured to run on boot.
- Configurations have been tested and verified.
- Future Plans
	- Deploy the full website: Replace the "Under Construction" page with a full, functional website.
	- Database integration: Set up a database (e.g., SQLite or MySQL) and connect it to the Laravel application.
	- User authentication: Implement a user login system to secure parts of the website.
	- Further automation: Create a script for automatic updates of the Laravel application.
